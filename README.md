# BookShop List Report

Welcome to your new project.

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide


## Things it performs

- List Report using CAP Project with GET Service and unbound action
- Making the List Report Editable
- Calling the action from List Report to save the changes
- Button Visibility Control and use of editFlow in Fiori
- Disable Automatic PATCH calls when editing the List Report fields (Temporarily by disabling TwoWay Binding)
- Implementation of DefaultValueFunction for Bound Action.
